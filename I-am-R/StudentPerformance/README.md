# 🧠 Student Performance Insights (R Project)

This beginner R project explores a fictional dataset of student academic performance to help practice essential data analysis skills.

## 🗂 Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains raw CSV data file.
- `scripts/`: R script(s) for cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `outputs/`: Summary results and exported plots.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🔍 Goals

- Import and explore real-world structured data.
- Apply data wrangling with `dplyr`.
- Create charts using `ggplot2`.
- Deal with missing values.
- Export cleaned data and insights.

## 🧾 Task Description

As a junior data management intern, in this task we will analyze academic performance data of students from various demographic backgrounds. The dataset includes test scores in Math, Reading, and Writing, along with metadata such as gender, lunch type, parental education level, and test preparation course completion.

I'm expected to:

- Load and inspect the dataset from `data/students_performance.csv`.
- Clean the data by checking for and handling missing or inconsistent values.
- Use `dplyr` to summarize average scores by categories like gender and parental education.
- Visualize trends using `ggplot2`:
  - Score distributions
  - Group-wise comparisons
- Save summary statistics and plots to the `outputs/` folder.

The goal is to gain insight into what factors may influence student performance while building your R analysis workflow.

## 📦 Requirements

Install the following R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "readr"))
````
