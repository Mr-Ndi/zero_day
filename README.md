## This is the repository for the stuffs that are being tested for the first time



### **Socket Programming**  a node and react application created on 13,Feb,2025 just by following Web Dev Simplifieds
### **bwambere** - My First Flutter App

This is a simple Flutter application that I created as part of my learning journey with Flutter. It's a small project where I experimented with creating a user interface, integrating assets, and exploring the basics of Flutter development. The app features a **purple-themed interface** with a **simple layout** that includes an **AppBar** and a **Center widget** to display text.

In the future, I plan to expand this app by adding more features and functionality, possibly exploring state management, network requests, and other advanced Flutter concepts.
